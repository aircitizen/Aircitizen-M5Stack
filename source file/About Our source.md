#About our Source.

The M5 STACK AIR CITIZEN SHIELD is made on the Air citizen Kit.
this kit was using the great tools made by a lot of maker industries (as SPARKFUN, Adafruit, SeedStudio)
so when it was time to integrate the project into one shield we used the beautiful documentation made by those manufacturer.

In this folder  you'll find all the documentation we used from those manufacturer and we thanks them a lot!
